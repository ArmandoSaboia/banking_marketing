# UCI Banking Marketing Problem

This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit with a bank based on various demographic and transactional factors. The data set used in this project is from the UCI Banking Marketing Data Set and includes information on over 45,000 customers.

## Requirements
To run the code for this project, you will need Python 3 and the following libraries:

Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip or conda.

## Data

The UCI Banking Marketing Data Set includes information on customer demographics, transactional history, and previous marketing campaigns. The data set is available in CSV format and can be downloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository website.

##Methodology

This project uses logistic regression to develop a predictive model for term deposit subscription. The data is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features. The logistic regression model is trained on a portion of the data and tested on a separate portion to evaluate its accuracy.

## Results

The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 89% in predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not. The analysis of the data set also revealed several insights, including the importance of follow-up in converting potential customers and the impact of demographic factors on customer behavior.

## Conclusion

The development of a predictive model for term deposit subscription using logistic regression can help banks better target potential customers and improve their marketing effectiveness. Additionally, the insights gained from the analysis of the UCI Banking Marketing Data Set can inform future marketing strategies and help banks identify potential areas for improvement.
