## Project: Banking Marketing Problem

#I. Project Summary:
This project aims to develop a predictive model to determine whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit with a bank based on various demographic and transactional factors. The data set used in this project is from the UCI Banking Marketing Data Set and includes information on over 45,000 customers.

II. Introduction:
Banking industries provide various types of services like loans, deposits, etc. In this project, I will analyze data related to a bank's marketing campaign aimed at encouraging customers to subscribe to a term deposit. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model using machine learning techniques to determine if a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not, based on various demographic and transactional factors.

III. Problem Statement:
I will aim to answer the following question: Can we predict whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit with a bank based on various demographic and transactional factors?

IV. Dataset Description:
The dataset contains 41188 rows and 21 columns. The columns include information such as age, job, marital status, education, default status, housing loan, personal loan, contact type, date of contact, duration, campaign, number of days before previous contact, number of contacts before this campaign, outcome of previous campaigns, and whether or not the customer has subscribed to the term deposit.

V. Methods and Algorithms:
I will begin by exploring the dataset using EDA, and then perform data wrangling to clean up the data and prepare it for machine learning modeling. I will use various classification algorithms to predict the target variable (whether or not a customer will subscribe to the term deposit) including lazypredict and pycaret libraries. I will create a visualization dashboard to showcase the results of the models. I will also use shap, which is an explainability tool, to explain the insights gained from the model.

VI. Project Analysis:
I will first import the libraries and dataset, then perform EDA to understand the data and clean the data for modeling. I will then split the data into training and testing sets, deploy the machine learning models using lazypredict and pycaret libraries, and select the best model. I will then create a visualization dashboard to showcase the results of the model, use shap to explain the insights of the model, and store the project in a GitHub repository.

VII. Final Results:
I will present the accuracy, precision and recall for the best-performing model and interpret the results with the help of shap. I will also present the visualization dashboard.

VIII. Conclusion and Future Scope:
I will conclude the project by summarizing the findings and the success of our predictive model. Future scope includes analyzing more demographic and transactional factors and an iterative approach to the model building process.

## Results

The logistic regression model achieved an accuracy of approximately 89% in predicting whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit or not. 
The analysis of the data set also revealed several insights, including the importance of follow-up in converting potential customers and the impact of demographic factors on customer behavior.

## Conclusion

The development of a predictive model for term deposit subscription using logistic regression can help banks better target potential customers and improve their marketing effectiveness. Additionally, the insights gained from the analysis of the UCI Banking Marketing Dataset can inform future marketing strategies and help banks identify potential areas for improvement.
